GAME TIMER
[x] Make a monad!
[ ] Queue up commands. You CAN'T remove old ones
[ ] 

GAME TIMER
I need a new data type
  lookup by point
  lookup by id
  
  (build multiple indexes)

  this could be represented by two maps

  Start With: [Bot]
  Conver to: GameState
  
  data GameState = GameState { game :: Game, bots :: Map String Bot, points :: Map Point String, commands :: [BotCommand] }

  UPDATE A LOCATION: updates points index (re-insert, delete old one), update x & y in bots

  Keep track of updates instead? (nice for saving and notifying people, but who cares?, really, I'm serializing everything anyway)

  Associate Bots and Commands more closely. They are all shared!

  update: updates the bot index
  move: moves something to x

  All info about a bot:
    Bot
    Location
    Command
  
  It's not hard to ignore a bot that has no command. It's not hard to reset them either
  It will be easier to map them like this 
  It's sort of like a big ol' index of stuff
  {command: {direction: action: }}

  Woot = 
    henry: bob


NEXT STEPS
[x] Get the leaderboards to display (and refresh?)
[x] Click on bot for information
[x] API: pick your own image
[x] Leaderboard: top killers
[x] Leaderboard: link to bot overlay (url based?)

AFTER THAT
[ ] Game Timer
[ ] Documentation
  [ ] Simple page that shows images you can pick
[ ] Evil Monsters! Bwa ha ha


GAME TIMER
Advantages: automatically limits the number of actions you can take. Can write game logic in haskell, instead of mongo. Maybe easier to keep track of events if I want to do things that way. Just try it and see how it feels

Disadvantages: not concurrent. I have to make sure the game can handle all the processing (with 1s ticks? please! I can handle the world on a 1s tick). 
    can it be parallized? (not without re-introducing mongo)
    it can by "room" (ah ha!)
    I don't think this is a good reason not to do it.

EVENT BASED
You don't have to sent down events. You just send down invalidated units. everything else is the same as before. (more important with blocks, eh?)

IDEAS
[ ] Have a store. Collect coins, not powerups. BUY powerups. Multiple kinds of powerfuls (Gold, Crystal)
[ ] Powerups: shoot 2 spaces. Multiple actions per actions
[ ] Have spawning guys be a resource of some kind. Kills or money let you spawn. start with 1, you can spend 1 spawn any time something dies.
[ ] Multiple types of creeps: Troll, vs little animals. They use different AI/strategy. Worth different amounts of money.
[ ] Blocks - requires belt of giant strength. stone requires belt of awesome giant strength
[ ] Trading
[ ] If you die you lose all your gold, so you have an incentive to drop it.

CLEANUP
[ ] Tighter /game/minions call
[ ] Gzip / Varnish / Cache-Control header
[ ] Indexes (player name, etc)

BOTS
[ ] write a simple monster bot

TODO
√ 2a. Track kills
√ 2b. Track time alive
√ 2c. Kills/ time alive leaderboards
2d. Display leaderboards somewhere
2e. Click on bot for information / links

[ ] Choose any image for bot. (URL Based (or should I provide the options?)) - it will have more uniform art if I provide the options. Just provide an index.
    - make a single sprite sheet

CLEANUP
don't send down as many fields to the /minions call

MAKE A BOT THAT
3. randomly spawn monsters, and stars

///// ??? ///////
try switching to single game tick/loop

LATER
4. randomly spawn stars. collect stars. stars leaderboard

DONT DO THESE
4. add blocks, randomly spawn them. 
5. allow them to pick up blocks
