CLEANUP
[x] Fix sorcerers
[x] /commands
[x] Readme
[x] Tell people they need to add Content-Type header or they'll get an error
[x] They need double quotes. Say anything?
[x] Docs: it will come back with "dead" before removing you
[x] Make it more clear that the ID returned is json. you need to json decode it
[x] "Not Found" error on spawn minon. Probably player not found, but should be more specific
[ ] AI crashed :( not sure why (need to add logs, and auto-restart)
    [ ] Add logs!
    [ ] when he spawns a bunch of guys, then all the AI, it never comes back
    [ ] Probably happens when 0 things are on the field, the AI can't restart
[ ] Cleanup: Do I really want to remove the player?
    [ ] Maybe get rid of it. The AI will remove stuff
    [ ] add a cleanup bot
[ ] Make it easier for bots to reconnect if the server is down. Don't remove their players!
[ ] If someone is dead, their position should register as clear, not taken (allowing spawns)
[ ] Stop player deletion (or at least slow it down)

[ ] real signups? I don't have to have real signups. Just ask for people to sign up, and generate a player for them by hand, until you make it realz
    -- then I don't have to worry about them reconnecting, etc. I just give them a player name and ID

[ ]

IDEAS
[ ] Limit spawning: you can only spawn next to you, for gold. (first spawn is free though)
[ ] Are items ALWAYS expendable? Attack speed, it gets used up?
[ ] Armor = Expendable health 
[ ] Item: teleporters and invisibility cloaks
[ ] Item: teleport squares (portals) 
[ ] A chat / who's on thing. Show the most recent people

NEXT STEPS
[x] Make sure you can deploy it
[x] Cache Headers
[x] Indexes (player name, etc)
[x] Write AI bots!
[x] Documentation
[x] Make the game work like the docs (id strings)
[x] Death animation (remove white background)
[x] Different "halos" depending on alignment
[x] Highlight the bot in the game when you click on the leaderboard. Don't defocus the board. SELECT the bot and track.
[x] Sort actions randomly (there's always a chance you'll get away!). Double KO is much easier. (Bot commands go through!)
[x] Death animation SPLAT
[x] Limit survivors list to 10
[x] Stats sheet always says 0 kills
[x] Wrong monster when you click on rats (from the line above??)

FRIENDS RELEASE
[x] Talk about long-term plans
[x] Image Picker (or split out the images?) (on documentation)
[-] Change leaderboards to use normal /objects call. It'll be simpler. 
[ ] Put it up on a server
[ ] Friends: (Scott, i.TV, Dude, Ryan)
[ ] Write an email (utahjs, uflash, cocoaheads, provo-html5)

MAYBE
[ ] Fix Sorcerer AI
[x] AI - depends on how many people are in the room total, not ITS total
[ ] AI - only one sorcerer EVER. (not just less common)

ALPHA RELEASE
[ ] Change leaderboards to be permanant with rollover (minute, hour, day, month, year, etc) (top 5 in each?)
[ ] Queue up commands. You CAN'T remove old ones
[ ] Varnish (make sure it works)

REAL RELEASE
[ ] Real domain 
[ ] Blog post? (no, internal release first)
[ ] Gzip?
[ ] Spawn limit
[-] Tighten up /game/objects

COOL NEW FEATURES
[ ] Real sign up (limit players!)
[ ] Spawning as a resource
[ ] Gold
[ ] Blocks
[ ] Store / Powerups
[ ] Trading

DONE
[x] Get the leaderboards to display (and refresh?)
[x] Click on bot for information
[x] API: pick your own image
[x] Leaderboard: top killers
[x] Leaderboard: link to bot overlay (url based?)
[x] Game Timer: Make a monad!

IDEAS
[ ] Have a store. Collect coins, not powerups. BUY powerups. Multiple kinds of powerfuls (Gold, Crystal)
[ ] Powerups: shoot 2 spaces. Multiple actions per actions
[ ] Have spawning guys be a resource of some kind. Kills or money let you spawn. start with 1, you can spend 1 spawn any time something dies.
[ ] Multiple types of creeps: Troll, vs little animals. They use different AI/strategy. Worth different amounts of money.
[ ] Blocks - requires belt of giant strength. stone requires belt of awesome giant strength
[ ] Trading
[ ] If you die you lose all your gold, so you have an incentive to drop it.
