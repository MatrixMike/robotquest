IDEAS
[ ] Have a store. Collect coins, not powerups. BUY powerups. Multiple kinds of powerfuls (Gold, Crystal)
[ ] Powerups: shoot 2 spaces. Multiple actions per actions
[ ] Have spawning guys be a resource of some kind. Kills or money let you spawn. start with 1, you can spend 1 spawn any time something dies.
[ ] Multiple types of creeps: Troll, vs little animals. They use different AI/strategy. Worth different amounts of money.
[ ] Blocks - requires belt of giant strength. stone requires belt of awesome giant strength
[ ] Trading
[ ] If you die you lose all your gold, so you have an incentive to drop it.
